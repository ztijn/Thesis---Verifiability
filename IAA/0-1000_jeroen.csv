Maybe they show malice here because they realize that people are careless and will likely have to buy a new adapter. Apple, however, has stated on several occasions that their goal is wireless. On an anecdotal note, I’ve owned an iPhone 7 since October 2016 and I still have and use my original adapter every day. I even bought a spare to use at the gym. Also, keep in mind, that most people just use the pair of earbuds they got in the box with their phone - which in the case of the iPhone 7/+ and 8/+ is a pair of lightning EarPods.

I also maintain that apple’s cables are built well. Generally speaking, however, people treat the cables like shit. Again, not apple’s fault. Again, maybe Apple knows that people treat cables like shit so they make a cable that works but needs to be replaced when it’s treated poorly. I buy Apple cables because I don’t treat mine like shit and I’d rather buy something that definitely isn’t gonna fry my battery - I’m cautious even with MFi certified products.

They really like quality, at the end of the day most programs on MAC have little to no issues when compared to the PC environment. This results in much less inventory but higher quality, in order to develop for OS you must do extensive testing and make sure things dont break, while on the PC world it's a lot quicker and easier to push your product out (faulty or not). While this has advantages/disadvantages, Apple decided it wanted to control the quality of its products, hence the higher requirements to develop both hardware and software for apple.

t3_71l9yj,dncxjlb,"For the majority of people, who just want something that works and don't want to worry about spec sheets and want a bunch of devices that work with each other well out of the box with little to no setup, Apple is more than worth the convenience and peace of mind.","I don't use apple products exclusively, but I have owned macbooks, ipads, and ipods (never an iphone though) and the reason that I buy apple products and the reason I recommend them to people who need new computers or phones is for one simple reason: consistency. Apple has a limited, easy to understand line of products that just work. They work well and they work for a substantial amount of time compared to many similar devices.

What would make you think this?

On a different but similar level: Police.

The police force enforce an aspect of the will of the government, which stands behind the laws we've made. Police make communities safer from obvious crime with their presence or by taking action against criminals. So that is their purpose. To enforce and protect the law.

The army has a similar but different function. Armies defend nations, and also carry out the will of their government, defending the resources the country relies on or securing border lines, passage routes, everything that enables stable development.

MY POINT: Without an army, the government will still need to TAKE ACTION to ensure the citizens/communities are safe and provided for. If there was no army, this would fall on to the police forces in the communities, because people/companies/governments still want stuff. Essentially, you would still need an army to function as a country, or form alliances with someone who has one. Trade is the ONLY other way we can overcome this, by increasing access to resources for everyone and reducing the effectiveness of an army over time. The army was necessary to ensure the resources were secure initially but trade can overcome it.

Can the blame really be put on a soldier for this? The need is created by the system we have in place. The need will be there until it's no longer needed. Unless you're willing to argue that it is in the best interest for poor people to want to die or suffer rather than join the army?

On a different but similar level: Police.

The police force enforce an aspect of the will of the government, which stands behind the laws we've made. Police make communities safer from obvious crime with their presence or by taking action against criminals. So that is their purpose. To enforce and protect the law.

The army has a similar but different function. Armies defend nations, and also carry out the will of their government, defending the resources the country relies on or securing border lines, passage routes, everything that enables stable development.

MY POINT: Without an army, the government will still need to TAKE ACTION to ensure the citizens/communities are safe and provided for. If there was no army, this would fall on to the police forces in the communities, because people/companies/governments still want stuff.

t3_5jfqhp,dbgqrn0,So factor that in.,"So if what I'm interpreting is correct, with no soldiers there would be no war? Basically? So without clean up crews, there would be no litter? Without Police officers there would be no crime? Without farmers there would be no food? Actually that last one makes sense, but you get my point. Tools don't prevent the results. There will always be war, people will find a new tool if there aren't any soldiers. A lot of destruction is caused by a handful of people anyway. It only took one plane to drop a bomb on Hiroshima.

I read your opening post, but could not find any argument that are relevant to the CMV prompt. Reading your responses to others, it seems to me that your argument against the deterrent argument is that the opposing force would also have no army. That's doesn't make sense. 

The reality is that other nations have military forces. Not having a military force puts your country at risk of being exploited. Regardless of your choices, or the choices of people in your nation, it will not change the fact that peoples from other nations have militaries and will continue to maintain them. Historically, wars of unification are sought with a justification to end all wars by putting everyone under one banner. That is a situation where one power exerts overwhelming power to enforce peace. You hope for another way. The premise of that way must be one where your nation can still get the results of having a deterrent force without actually having one, while allowing the rights of other nation states to maintain forces of their own.

If you can solve that,  and you'll deserve the nobel peace prize. Without that, soldiers serving their nation are not perpetuating war. On the contrary, they are perpetuating peace. The peace that exists right now. ",780,UnVerif,1,784,2022-04-26T15:19:11.207261Z,2022-04-26T15:19:11.207291Z,3.623,,

As you say, your idea is totally infeasible; it follows that we live in a world where we either need to be ready to be violent or we need to have people people willing to do violence on our behalf.

I don't know why you single out national armies, because in practice, that's the best thing to have.  A volunteer national army selects those in society willing to fight, segregates and organizes them, imposes rules and discipline, and places them under the command of civilian leaders.  They are subject to law and follow orders from civilian authorities.

In a world where you need people willing to do violence, that's the best kind of violent people to have: enthusiastic volunteers willing to follow orders, as opposed to a mob that does what it wants because it has the biggest guns or that follows a leader because he's the strongest and promises them the most spoils.

Your view is one of many in a greater debate about the fundamental nature of mankind: If civilization were removed - with its national pride and drive for resources taken with it - would mankind be peaceful, or violent? 

Unfortunately, the question itself is moot; whether or not mankind as a whole were peaceful is irrelevant because there only needs to be violent individuals, few and far between, to trigger cycles of violence. These violent individuals will have to be met with violence in order to insure the survival of the whole. One this has happened, it is no longer just these individuals who must be considered violent; it is the home. TL;DR: Humans are violent.

Your view is one of many in a greater debate about the fundamental nature of mankind: If civilization were removed - with its national pride and drive for resources taken with it - would mankind be peaceful, or violent?

And over all, everyone is created equal and is worth the same. No one is worth more or less than anyone else. ",241,NonArg,1,245,2022-04-25T20:10:04.146967Z,2022-04-25T20:10:04.146995Z,4.547,,

I have a couple of thoughts about your view. 

The first is that while you're not advocating for me or people like me to be killed, you are advocating that myself and people like should never have been born to begin with. Which, for future generations of people like me, kind of amounts to the same thing; non-existence. I'm wondering what gives you, or anyone else for that matter, the moral authority to say whether or not I should exist?

Your argument seems to be that we're a burden on society, without redeeming value to justify that burden. To this I would urge you to explore the many, varied, and wonderful contributions disabled people have made to society. Much like you, many of us are a part of a community of friends, family, &amp; neighbors, and participate in a mutual enriching of one another's lives. Like some abled people, some disabled people even make broader contributions to society, often by applying their own unique perspective. 

Perhaps you're thinking that I fall above your threshold for ""severe,"" in which case: who gets to decide where that threshold is, and how? At what point do someone's contributions become irrelevant, and do you think science will be able to accurately predict which disabled people have the potential to be good friend/family/neighbors/members of society and which will fall below this hypothetical threshold?

You're talking about a tax burden vs. the life of an individual. I understand what you're saying, but it's an inhumane point of view, and the overall tax burden is peanuts to the tax burden of welfare against poverty. The last 50 years have shown us that government spending of money to combat poverty has had a (sadly) low success rate. Should we euthanize people living in poverty for them to attain benefits?

It's not a slippery slope argument, it's a straight up downward slope. No one should have the power to evaluate the value of a human life and be able to terminate it.

In theory, the idea of aborting certain types of fetuses or sterilizing the people that knowingly display risk factors for producing such a fetus sounds great and would greatly diminish the prevalence of disabilities, mental handicaps, genetic illnesses, and so on. But in practice, eugenics has always been a failed science. 


The US experimented with eugenics in mental hospitals before WWII. We sterilized schizophrenic patients in an attempt to curb the overwhelming numbers of new schizophrenia cases. Germany of course dabbled with racial (and medical) eugenics during the war. The question of consent was a non starter in both cases; schizophrenics technically could not give consent to be sterilized because of their mental capacity (and because of being under the influence of heavy medication), and of course no one in Germany gave consent to anything, but sterilizations (and deaths in Germany's case) were carried out regardless ""for the good of the people"". **neither scenario played out well in the end


In the case of aborting fetuses that show abnormalities, were arguing free will. Should a person carrying a fetus with downs be allowed to practice free will and decide to keep it or abort on their own, or should someone step in and take away that free will to mandate an abortion? 


In a moral sense, there really is no argument because everyone's moral compass is different and based off of individual experiences culminated over a lifetime.

t3_6rwcio,dl8j0ob,"But in practice, eugenics has always been a failed science.","You're essentially talking about practicing eugenics here, which is treacherous ground to tread. In theory, the idea of aborting certain types of fetuses or sterilizing the people that knowingly display risk factors for producing such a fetus sounds great and would greatly diminish the prevalence of disabilities, mental handicaps, genetic illnesses, and so on. But in practice, eugenics has always been a failed science. 


The US experimented with eugenics in mental hospitals before WWII. We sterilized schizophrenic patients in an attempt to curb the overwhelming numbers of new schizophrenia cases. Germany of course dabbled with racial (and medical) eugenics during the war. The question of consent was a non starter in both cases; schizophrenics technically could not give consent to be sterilized because of their mental capacity (and because of being under the influence of heavy medication), and of course no one in Germany gave consent to anything, but sterilizations (and deaths in Germany's case) were carried out regardless ""for the good of the people"". **neither scenario played out well in the end


In the case of aborting fetuses that show abnormalities, were arguing free will. Should a person carrying a fetus with downs be allowed to practice free will and decide to keep it or abort on their own, or should someone step in and take away that free will to mandate an abortion? 


In a moral sense, there really is no argument because everyone's moral compass is different and based off of individual experiences culminated over a lifetime.
