The question of consent was a non starter in both cases; schizophrenics technically could not give consent to be sterilized because of their mental capacity (and because of being under the influence of heavy medication), and of course no one in Germany gave consent to anything, but sterilizations (and deaths in Germany's case) were carried out regardless ""for the good of the people"". **neither scenario played out well in the end


In the case of aborting fetuses that show abnormalities, were arguing free will. Should a person carrying a fetus with downs be allowed to practice free will and decide to keep it or abort on their own, or should someone step in and take away that free will to mandate an abortion? 


In a moral sense, there really is no argument because everyone's moral compass is different and based off of individual experiences culminated over a lifetime. Some people morally oppose abortion; how would that be handled? Some people morally oppose even having sonograms or genetic testing done on (unborn) children, what then since they didn't know ahead of time?

I have a couple of thoughts about your view. 

The first is that while you're not advocating for me or people like me to be killed, you are advocating that myself and people like should never have been born to begin with. Which, for future generations of people like me, kind of amounts to the same thing; non-existence. I'm wondering what gives you, or anyone else for that matter, the moral authority to say whether or not I should exist?

Your argument seems to be that we're a burden on society, without redeeming value to justify that burden. To this I would urge you to explore the many, varied, and wonderful contributions disabled people have made to society. Much like you, many of us are a part of a community of friends, family, &amp; neighbors, and participate in a mutual enriching of one another's lives. Like some abled people, some disabled people even make broader contributions to society, often by applying their own unique perspective. 

Perhaps you're thinking that I fall above your threshold for ""severe,"" in which case: who gets to decide where that threshold is, and how? At what point do someone's contributions become irrelevant, and do you think science will be able to accurately predict which disabled people have the potential to be good friend/family/neighbors/members of society and which will fall below this hypothetical threshold?

Your view is one of many in a greater debate about the fundamental nature of mankind: If civilization were removed - with its national pride and drive for resources taken with it - would mankind be peaceful, or violent? 

Unfortunately, the question itself is moot; whether or not mankind as a whole were peaceful is irrelevant because there only needs to be violent individuals, few and far between, to trigger cycles of violence. These violent individuals will have to be met with violence in order to insure the survival of the whole. One this has happened, it is no longer just these individuals who must be considered violent; it is the home. TL;DR: Humans are violent.

So, if country A does not have a military, only police, and country B *does* have a military, country B *will* exploit the situation. History shows this happens time and time again. Until a global order is established, countries will compete for resources. This competition sometimes delves into violence, because that is a fundamental aspect of our species. Hopefully, we will eventually evolve out of it. In the meantime, we have not, and war is guaranteed to exist somewhere in the world.  

Following this model, volunteering to serve doesn't make you a perpetrator of war - only a participant in something that would be happening whether you were there or not.

War can still be fought without soldiers, ships, planes or guns. 

Everyone needs food, water, shelter and other resources to live their lives. When you run out of natural resources in your home, you natural go outside of your home to obtain natural resources. The same thing happens when your country runs out of natural resources. 

But all of that can be prevented with trade right? Yes it can, however many wars have started when country's don't recognize other countries  money. Money is just printed from nothing, so it's easy to dismiss the value of a foreign countries. You can have politicians decide to not trade with foreign countries for any excuse imaginable. Anything from a prince stealing a king's wife to accusing another country of owning weapons of mass destruction. 

So militaries are necessary to invade foreign countries for natural resources and also to defend from the invasion of foreign people from stealing your countries natural resources. 

So it's better to have a military that can serve it's citizens to take and to defend. Bottom line, it's necessary to have the ability to control money and natural resources. ",609,UnVerif,1,613,-,-,-,,

Their resources, wealth, security are all not implicitly assured, it needs to be able to protect it, either through military strength or strategic alliances with other countries.  

If your argument was there should be no war or aggression between men, I would wholeheatedly agree, but on a global level, we are still in the state of nature i mentioned earlier. In this world there will always be someone who tries to assert dominance or control over others, and is also reflected in global politics. Soldiers arent the weapon, they are a tool weilded by world leaders. Without them there are many other ways to wage war.

What would make you think this?

On a different but similar level: Police.

The police force enforce an aspect of the will of the government, which stands behind the laws we've made. Police make communities safer from obvious crime with their presence or by taking action against criminals. So that is their purpose. To enforce and protect the law.

The army has a similar but different function. Armies defend nations, and also carry out the will of their government, defending the resources the country relies on or securing border lines, passage routes, everything that enables stable development.

MY POINT: Without an army, the government will still need to TAKE ACTION to ensure the citizens/communities are safe and provided for. If there was no army, this would fall on to the police forces in the communities, because people/companies/governments still want stuff. Essentially, you would still need an army to function as a country, or form alliances with someone who has one. Trade is the ONLY other way we can overcome this, by increasing access to resources for everyone and reducing the effectiveness of an army over time. The army was necessary to ensure the resources were secure initially but trade can overcome it.

Can the blame really be put on a soldier for this? The need is created by the system we have in place. The need will be there until it's no longer needed. Unless you're willing to argue that it is in the best interest for poor people to want to die or suffer rather than join the army?

TL;DR don't hate the player, hate the game. Or change the game. The players only playing to win (live).

They really like quality, at the end of the day most programs on MAC have little to no issues when compared to the PC environment. This results in much less inventory but higher quality, in order to develop for OS you must do extensive testing and make sure things dont break, while on the PC world it's a lot quicker and easier to push your product out (faulty or not). While this has advantages/disadvantages, Apple decided it wanted to control the quality of its products, hence the higher requirements to develop both hardware and software for apple.

It's really a catch 22, we want them to try new things but then we get mad when they do ""A prime example is the iPhone 7 and its missing 3.5mm headphone jack"", while i agree it does not seem very practical at least they are trying new things out. A lot of what we consider essential was though of as weird at first.

2. OS

They really like quality, at the end of the day most programs on MAC have little to no issues when compared to the PC environment. This results in much less inventory but higher quality, in order to develop for OS you must do extensive testing and make sure things dont break, while on the PC world it's a lot quicker and easier to push your product out (faulty or not). While this has advantages/disadvantages, Apple decided it wanted to control the quality of its products, hence the higher requirements to develop both hardware and software for apple.

3. Own equipment

Back to quality, while there are 20+ brands you can buy for PC, there are limited options for MAC but this has always been the case.

True, Google release ARCore around the same time and other companies like Nvidia and Qualcomm are making big strides in computer vision, but a lot of what Apple did was in house and to a higher standard, and naturally those R&amp;D costs are passed down to consumers in the cost of the phones. Just seeing what Apple is able to do by levying computer vision on its camera software is spellbinding.

The phones themselves, on a hardware level, may be valued at $2-300 but when you account for everything else that went into it... I think $1000 or so is reasonable. If you don't see the value or potential in these new features, you really don't need to have the latest model iPhone as any phone from the last three years should suffice. ",952,UnVerif,1,956,-,-,-,,

Maybe they show malice here because they realize that people are careless and will likely have to buy a new adapter. Apple, however, has stated on several occasions that their goal is wireless. On an anecdotal note, I’ve owned an iPhone 7 since October 2016 and I still have and use my original adapter every day. I even bought a spare to use at the gym.

t3_71l9yj,dncl925,This goes the same for their computers and their mobile devices.,"Apple includes the 3.5mm to lightning adapter in the box of the 7/+ and the 8/+. I’ve said this before elsewhere but it’s not really apple’s fault that people are careless and lose their things. You could kinda argue Apple’s intentions in that regard. Maybe they show malice here because they realize that people are careless and will likely have to buy a new adapter. Apple, however, has stated on several occasions that their goal is wireless. On an anecdotal note, I’ve owned an iPhone 7 since October 2016 and I still have and use my original adapter every day. I even bought a spare to use at the gym. Also, keep in mind, that most people just use the pair of earbuds they got in the box with their phone - which in the case of the iPhone 7/+ and 8/+ is a pair of lightning EarPods.

I also maintain that apple’s cables are built well. Generally speaking, however, people treat the cables like shit. Again, not apple’s fault. Again, maybe Apple knows that people treat cables like shit so they make a cable that works but needs to be replaced when it’s treated poorly. I buy Apple cables because I don’t treat mine like shit and I’d rather buy something that definitely isn’t gonna fry my battery - I’m cautious even with MFi certified products.
