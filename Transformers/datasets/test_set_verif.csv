I personally have no problem just jumping down somebody's throat. I'll loquaciously speak my mind when I know I'm facing nearly unanimous opposition.  But a lot of people aren't like that.  A lot of people are scared of confrontation, scared of looking bad, scared of defending themselves, etc.

Maybe their ideas and points of view are revolutionary and will someday be considered the benchmark of a just society.  But we don't know unless they speak.  So maybe it's not be a bad idea to give people a safe space to speak their mind and be who they are.

The problem is, of course, the concept has been weaponized and policies meant to promote the exchange of ideas is instead being used to silence them.  Instead of opening the floor up for discussion about sexist traditional gender roles, the concept is instead used to silence rational discussion about other forms of gender inequity.  Instead of providing a space where minorities can speak their mind, it's used to categorically marginalize opposing opinion, and avoid even reasoned criticism (a la Melissa ""I need some muscle over here"" Click).

It is the case that this position is  often taken to an extreme at universities, though that is relatively common among my particular age demographic.

However, having some 'safe space' - some place where you can go to relax, be among people like you who aren't coming at you with arguments or insults or even general stuff that puts you out of sorts - is downright human. People need time to sort things out, to sit down and relax without being on-edge at having to deal with this or that jarring visual or argument or anything else.

This isn't to say universities or any other place is doing a good job of implementing these safe spaces. I'd say most of them suck.

t3_4ph4lk,d4mr8vu,It shows that you wanted to the put the time money and effort into studying something for four years at a high level.,"I think your philosophy disregards one of the most important things about a college degree in general. One of the biggest reasons why college degrees are important is that they show dedication. It shows that you wanted to the put the time money and effort into studying something for four years at a high level. That fact alone goes a long way towards demonstrating your usefulness in the work force. Save for things like engineering, IT and medicine which are very specialized fields, many jobs are learned once you get hired there.

If i have a job that i really enjoy (which is currently my case), after my 8 hour day, i had a lot of fun. I enjoyed my day. At the end of the week, i don't need to go out and do anything to be happier, i already enjoyed my week. I may have made a bit less, but i don't need to spend anything as a result so it's not such a big difference. Not only that, but i work side jobs in my field on my spare time. Since i love my job, it makes me even happier to go out and work, while making even more money. So in the end, I'm being paid to have fun on my time off that i spend with friends. 

Not to mention the fact that i love my job means im always looking for new ways to improve my work, always willing and eager to learn. It makes me very valuable to employers. As others have mentioned, it gives you security. And i still make as much per year as someone who makes more but doesn't enjoy their job as much.

If you focus on any of those three in isolation, you won't be successful. If you love poetry but you aren't good at it and nobody will pay you for it, it's a hobby. If you hate engineering and have no talent for it, the strong job market isn't going to make you successful. 

So sure, our education system spits out more mediocre philosophers than the job market can handle, but each individual must choose his career path based on more than the average earnings in the field. 

Edit: just to be clear, I know that you recognized that you can't hate what you study, but you should recognize the three pillars equally. A field that you love that pays okay is just as valid as a field that you are slightly interested in that pays okay. And how much it pays is very personal. The average author makes virtually nothing, but but those who are great, passionate, and make others feel strongly enough to spend money can succeed in every sense.

First there is informational asymmetry.  What is reported as jobs that are in high in demand and therefore high in earnings yield, often has a delay from what is actually true on the ground.

Just as any invention requires some discovery, there are parts of math that require the inventor to discover the use of specific logic to describe discovered aspects of the universe around us.

For example: One mathematician is discovering new uses for the work provided by a previous mathematician.

Math, sort of like language, is a tool for applying meaning, not just the things to which meaning is applied. 

That being said, and this is where I disagree with your view, it could not possibly exist without the natural phenomena either. It must consists of a marriage between the two.

Math is phenomena + meaning, not either of those things on their own.    ",5379,Verif,NonPers,Difficult,1,5379,2022-05-04T07:55:21.242975Z,2022-05-04T07:55:21.243007Z,5.177

I've always heard the phrase 'Math is the Language of the Universe'. This is how I choose to look at it. In my opinion, you are focusing on the 'notation' part of math. Learning math is half understanding the relationships being established and half understanding how to express those relationships.

I'll agree that there is likely a lower bound where I would agree it is too young to know these things but it's generally during the teenage years of puberty and sexual realisation that trans people can really start to understand what's happening to them and how to deal with it.

Define 'shredded' because that is really really important here. 

&gt; They shouldn't have to give away half of their household income. Yes, half.

[Did you know that Obama's 2011 ~1% increase on the top 2 brackets *annual income* would yield as much revenue as taking 1/2 of everything the poorest 50% owns (not their annual income, literally their entire wealth)](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/jfmt11/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-world-of-class-warfare---the-poor-s-free-ride-is-over)

&gt;  Too bad, you have to give away half of it so that lazy college grads can get their tuition paid for.

The same one who will be making the majority of the money in the future and will keep our infrastructure strong for generations to come?

t3_44w1wn,cztk081,A more educated population is not a bad thing in any way.,"&gt;people who get wealthy risked just about everything to get there

Some people become poor by risking everything. Are they pieces of shit? What makes the people who ended up successful any more special? 

&gt;They shouldn't have to give away half of their household income. Yes, half.

So I see from other comments that you do actually understand how marginal tax rates work so this statement is misleading. Even if the top marginal tax rate was 50%, you would have to make about $10 million per year before your income was effectively halved. People at that level probably make much of their money from capital gains which is taxed differently. Not to mention all the write-offs and loopholes they benefit from.

&gt;Asking for Bernie's student debt forgiveness is a short-sighted, quick fix that you want because you're feeling the pressure of student loans on your bank account. Again, don't be selfish.

He's not advocating forgiveness of student loans across the board. From what I can find it seems that he may be saying that loan forgiveness might be appropriate in some rare cases. More importantly his  plan is to reduce interest rates on student loans and to make the *first two years of community college* free. 

&gt;But if my degree was included with my parent's taxes, the demand for my skills would be lower.

Most of the very rich were born that way and there are whole industries designed to keep them that way. People who have recently become upper class generally have the deck stacked in their favor and didn't have that far to climb to make it to that upper echelon. 

The fact of the matter is there is far less social mobility, that is ; ability to improve ones circumstances, in America than in other parts of the world. Poverty has become a trap, not because people are lazy and refuse to work, but because work, especially labor, is no longer paid enough to secure a comfortable life.

Lowering the financial burden of college doesn't lessen the the amount of knowledge learned or how rigorous an achievement is. It simply allows smart, hardworking people who otherwise couldn't not afford higher education to get educated in a field of their choosing. If anything, increasing the amount of people who are able to go to college would increase competion. This would cause getting into a good program to be more impressive than otherwise.

Likewise, most Bernie Sanders' supporters don't want everyone to make the same wage. Innovators, business owners and employees that have large stress/workload demands will still get paid significantly more than the unskilled worker. However, by narrowing this gap you open the options for many hardworking people to succeed. That person who works two jobs to stay afloat and cant afford the money nor time to get a degree in their passion might be able to quit one job to go back to school part time. Those families who weren't fortunate enough to come from a rich past wont have to worry as much about if they can pay their rent or if they can give their children a childhood they think they deserve. Plus they would be able to spend more money which would be reinvested in the economy.

I think the reason that the younger generation speaks the loudest in a need for change is because they are firsthand experiencing these struggles that their parents and especially their grandparents never had to contend with on this scale.

It simply allows smart, hardworking people who otherwise couldn't not afford higher education to get educated in a field of their choosing. If anything, increasing the amount of people who are able to go to college would increase competion. This would cause getting into a good program to be more impressive than otherwise.

Likewise, most Bernie Sanders' supporters don't want everyone to make the same wage. Innovators, business owners and employees that have large stress/workload demands will still get paid significantly more than the unskilled worker. However, by narrowing this gap you open the options for many hardworking people to succeed. That person who works two jobs to stay afloat and cant afford the money nor time to get a degree in their passion might be able to quit one job to go back to school part time. Those families who weren't fortunate enough to come from a rich past wont have to worry as much about if they can pay their rent or if they can give their children a childhood they think they deserve. Plus they would be able to spend more money which would be reinvested in the economy.

I think the reason that the younger generation speaks the loudest in a need for change is because they are firsthand experiencing these struggles that their parents and especially their grandparents never had to contend with on this scale. Being the main victims of certain problems does not inherently make the desire to address these problem selfish, as these issues are a widespread issue supported with facts rather than just a personal frustration.

The same may be true to some extent for you: not because debating changed your mind, but because you needed to think about it in order to debate it and that in turn caused you to examine your own beliefs.

The thing is, I don't really care how low the odds are: it's something that matters to me and defines who I am, so it's something I feel compelled to do. I like to write and debate (I think it helps my job to sharpen my debating skills too), and I like standing up for something I believe in. 

I think there are a lot of parallels across all walks of life: anti-nuclear protesters, animal rights activists, Occupy Wall Street, and so on - it doesn't matter what the level of success any such people realistically expect from their actions, what matters is standing up for what you believe.

t3_4dvspm,d1ve7br,And there is information this detailed about all religions.,"My husband converted perhaps due to my influence. He was a Muslim before we met. 

I'm a theologian with specialty in moral leadership and peace-building. I find learning about religion much more convincing and enjoyable than debating it. 

Debates tend to go in circles, while if you learn about for example how much of a hippie Jesus was and how the bible came to be written, the passages that are repeated, how it contrasts with what people believe nowadays, and how the writers of the bible as well as current clergy insert their own worldview into the religion - that is what I call interesting. There isn't even any need for debate when you can access all that information. And there is information this detailed about all religions. That way, one can come to her own conclusions. 

Between a believer and a non-believer, the debate is too divided to be truly fruitful, as the basic premises that one bases the arguments on are completely different.

How they giggle at certain things that make them laugh, enjoy certain movies or like being tickled.

&gt;We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and **_secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity_**, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

The word posterity was a very ""lost"" word to me reading over the Constitution until it was pointed out by my father what it meant.  Offspring.  Our founding fathers was so respectful of life that they protected it in the Constitution.

Roe v. Wade really started a slippery slope that eroded the respect of life.  After all, if life doesn't begin at conception (though to be fair to the argument, the moment that the baby is noticeable in the mother), then when does the moment that life begin?  At birth?  Even later?

The philosopher Peter Singer holds the view that the right to life is tied to the capacity to hold preferences.  This would essentially mean that crimes such as euthanasia and infanticide would be okay because the victim, who can't make a choice on the matter, can't really be defined as a human being for making that choice?

No, our founders respected life because of what it can give to everyone.

The Founders has a very interesting way in respecting life - So much so that they enshrined it in our Constitution:

&gt;We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and **_secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity_**, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

The word posterity was a very ""lost"" word to me reading over the Constitution until it was pointed out by my father what it meant.  Offspring.  Our founding fathers was so respectful of life that they protected it in the Constitution.

Roe v. Wade really started a slippery slope that eroded the respect of life.  After all, if life doesn't begin at conception (though to be fair to the argument, the moment that the baby is noticeable in the mother), then when does the moment that life begin?  At birth?  Even later?

The philosopher Peter Singer holds the view that the right to life is tied to the capacity to hold preferences.  This would essentially mean that crimes such as euthanasia and infanticide would be okay because the victim, who can't make a choice on the matter, can't really be defined as a human being for making that choice?

No, our founders respected life because of what it can give to everyone.

Do you think that old people who have reached a point of no return in life (wearing diapers... can't feed themselves) should be euthanized even if it is against their or their family's wishes (imagine the family has $ to keep them alive..)?  When you say it should be mandatory for one to be put to death because of such disabilities - it opens the doors for other people being put to death for the same thing - oh.. and Steven Hawking would probably fit into this.
