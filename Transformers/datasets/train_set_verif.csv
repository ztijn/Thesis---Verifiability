Some people morally oppose even having sonograms or genetic testing done on (unborn) children, what then since they didn't know ahead of time?

Yes, they may not grow in maturity, but they continue to show the human condition when others fail to. These people still offer their public a lot. They may not be as productive. But their goodness, kindness, and innocence shows us what we can aspire to be like on a daily basis. They have grown in the goodness factor.  I think that counts for a lot in the world that we live in today. And if they are reminding people of goodness, then that could be keeping us from imploding.

t3_6rwcio,dl8aveq,She is autistic and used her perspective on the world to innovate how we treat livestock.,"From my reading of your question, you are trying to make the point that a person born with (certain levels of) mental retardation cannot positively impact society. Instead they can only consume valuable state resources. 

To counter this view, I think you can look at the history of people with disabilities as an ongoing effort to appreciate their talents. One of the famous examples of this is Temple Grandin. She is autistic and used her perspective on the world to innovate how we treat livestock. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Grandin

You can reply by saying that she is ""higher level"" and that there are people who are too developmentally delayed to be anything but a burden. However, can you be certain that this is an absolute fact? With this argument, you may be aligning yourself with the people who dismissed Helen Keller or Temple Grandin or other people as never being able to amount to anything. I think the key to changing your viewpoint is to reevaluate the impact that people with disabilities can have on society, particularly the unique perspectives that they offer.

There are so many tax burdens that could be deemed unfair and caused by actions of people that should know better, not by a completely innocent fetus.  You have punctured the most basic thread of Life, Liberty and Happiness FOR ALL.  ( All means all).  Old people are a tax burden to young.  Smokers are a tax burden.  People in jail are a tax burden.  People who eat meat are causing global catastrophe as are people that drive gas cars.  Do we wipe them all out and who decides?  I think a better approach may be to learn how to fix the genes that cause downs. We are close to that already.

Your view is one of many in a greater debate about the fundamental nature of mankind: If civilization were removed - with its national pride and drive for resources taken with it - would mankind be peaceful, or violent? 

Unfortunately, the question itself is moot; whether or not mankind as a whole were peaceful is irrelevant because there only needs to be violent individuals, few and far between, to trigger cycles of violence. These violent individuals will have to be met with violence in order to insure the survival of the whole. One this has happened, it is no longer just these individuals who must be considered violent; it is the home. TL;DR: Humans are violent.

So, if country A does not have a military, only police, and country B *does* have a military, country B *will* exploit the situation. History shows this happens time and time again. Until a global order is established, countries will compete for resources. This competition sometimes delves into violence, because that is a fundamental aspect of our species. Hopefully, we will eventually evolve out of it. In the meantime, we have not, and war is guaranteed to exist somewhere in the world.  

Following this model, volunteering to serve doesn't make you a perpetrator of war - only a participant in something that would be happening whether you were there or not.

Their resources, wealth, security are all not implicitly assured, it needs to be able to protect it, either through military strength or strategic alliances with other countries.

In this world there will always be someone who tries to assert dominance or control over others, and is also reflected in global politics.

In reality though, the military is just money. Countries use it to get what they want and protect what they have. Always have and always will. If there weren't soldiers, countries have a variety of other ways to get what they want, from actual money to slander/libel to assainations. Countries aren't going to become peaceful just because they don't have a military. Politicians will still have disputes that will cause people to die or be imprisoned.


A lot of what you're seeing now with the support the troops stuff is the civilian populace trying not to pull another post-Vietnam war thing. Veterans got treated like the scum of the earth after Vietnam, even when a lot of them were just support personel or joined up because their brother did or something. People are trying not to recreate that with gulf war veterans.

On a different but similar level: Police.

The police force enforce an aspect of the will of the government, which stands behind the laws we've made. Police make communities safer from obvious crime with their presence or by taking action against criminals. So that is their purpose. To enforce and protect the law.

The army has a similar but different function. Armies defend nations, and also carry out the will of their government, defending the resources the country relies on or securing border lines, passage routes, everything that enables stable development.

MY POINT: Without an army, the government will still need to TAKE ACTION to ensure the citizens/communities are safe and provided for. If there was no army, this would fall on to the police forces in the communities, because people/companies/governments still want stuff. Essentially, you would still need an army to function as a country, or form alliances with someone who has one. Trade is the ONLY other way we can overcome this, by increasing access to resources for everyone and reducing the effectiveness of an army over time.

Back to quality, while there are 20+ brands you can buy for PC, there are limited options for MAC but this has always been the case.","1. Innovation

It's really a catch 22, we want them to try new things but then we get mad when they do ""A prime example is the iPhone 7 and its missing 3.5mm headphone jack"", while i agree it does not seem very practical at least they are trying new things out. A lot of what we consider essential was though of as weird at first.

2. OS

They really like quality, at the end of the day most programs on MAC have little to no issues when compared to the PC environment. This results in much less inventory but higher quality, in order to develop for OS you must do extensive testing and make sure things dont break, while on the PC world it's a lot quicker and easier to push your product out (faulty or not). While this has advantages/disadvantages, Apple decided it wanted to control the quality of its products, hence the higher requirements to develop both hardware and software for apple.

Before I became a software engineer, I used to hate Apple with a passion and have a similar view as yours (which technically is as much a result of marketing from the rest of the industry, that value specs over experience). 

Than I learned way more about their engineering design, software integration and user experience.  Apple is a rare bread of company that can pull off what would take 2 or more company to achieve.  Sometimes people think of Apple as this Giant company, but if you consider that they do all this software, hardware and sales on their own, they do it with less human resources than all other products on the market.

Also after taking courses in the sociology of technology, you come to realize that Apple is doing something very difficult very successfuly.  Making people embrace chance is the most difficult step of a new technology (not developing it, and not manufacturing it).  Many great technology achievements were lost by lack of understanding of the human sociology.  Apple are arguably the best in the world in their industry in the sociology aspect of the technology.

t3_71l9yj,dncl925,Their software only works on their hardware.,"Apple includes the 3.5mm to lightning adapter in the box of the 7/+ and the 8/+. I’ve said this before elsewhere but it’s not really apple’s fault that people are careless and lose their things. You could kinda argue Apple’s intentions in that regard. Maybe they show malice here because they realize that people are careless and will likely have to buy a new adapter. Apple, however, has stated on several occasions that their goal is wireless. On an anecdotal note, I’ve owned an iPhone 7 since October 2016 and I still have and use my original adapter every day. I even bought a spare to use at the gym. Also, keep in mind, that most people just use the pair of earbuds they got in the box with their phone - which in the case of the iPhone 7/+ and 8/+ is a pair of lightning EarPods.

I also maintain that apple’s cables are built well. Generally speaking, however, people treat the cables like shit. Again, not apple’s fault. Again, maybe Apple knows that people treat cables like shit so they make a cable that works but needs to be replaced when it’s treated poorly. I buy Apple cables because I don’t treat mine like shit and I’d rather buy something that definitely isn’t gonna fry my battery - I’m cautious even with MFi certified products.

http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-laz-iphonecost-20140917-story.html

If we assume the iPhone X costs around $400 to make, and sells for $1000, that is not as huge of a margin as you might think.  Also if you compare it to something like household furniture which is often marked up 200-400%, its not that bad.

Some of these calculations of the real cost of the phone also don't include labor and other costs, and instead just add up the cost of the individual components inside the phone.

Other costs include the marketing and creating the ""brand"" you mentioned in the CMV.  Also Apple has a history of in-house R&amp;D and making its own components, the new Apple A11 is just the newest example of this.  

Finally, its also a pretty objective fact that Apple knows what it's doing.  If you look at the history, and how it was quite recently the most valuable corporation in the world. The new iPhone might launch it back up there again.

You also have to ask yourself what are the other companies doing? Oh yeah Samsung phones burst into flames sometimes.  The head of Samsung is likely going to spend sometime in jail, convicted on corruption charges, their company is constantly involved with scandals.

If we assume the iPhone X costs around $400 to make, and sells for $1000, that is not as huge of a margin as you might think.  Also if you compare it to something like household furniture which is often marked up 200-400%, its not that bad.

Some of these calculations of the real cost of the phone also don't include labor and other costs, and instead just add up the cost of the individual components inside the phone.

Other costs include the marketing and creating the ""brand"" you mentioned in the CMV.  Also Apple has a history of in-house R&amp;D and making its own components, the new Apple A11 is just the newest example of this.  

Finally, its also a pretty objective fact that Apple knows what it's doing.  If you look at the history, and how it was quite recently the most valuable corporation in the world. The new iPhone might launch it back up there again.

You also have to ask yourself what are the other companies doing? Oh yeah Samsung phones burst into flames sometimes.  The head of Samsung is likely going to spend sometime in jail, convicted on corruption charges, their company is constantly involved with scandals.

Legal, while only some parts of US have legalized recreational marijuana and the whole drug war thing is loads better in Germany than the US in general, pot is still technically illegal in Germany, even though most Germans probably live closer to places where pot is legal than most Americans.

Drivers licenses. In America every idiot is allowed to drive a car. In Germany too but you have to be older and pay a huge amount of money for official driving lessons.

For schooling, the US university system is still the best in the world, although challenged by the poor K-12 system. Also, homeschooling is illegal in Germany; their is no tolerance for certain types of dissent. Immigration has been a huge benefit to the US throughout its history and the resulting culture is the most diverse in the world. This means that the variety of great cuisines in the US is unmatched. I'll be a bit snarky and say that likely the most world-recognized German product is beer, and the flourishing US micro/nano-brewery movement is imporving faster then the regulated German beer industry.

As someone who moved on to much more in depth fantasy, the rules of magic aren't well explained and can be inconsistent.  The problems of not learning anything math, modern history, ect. in school after age 11 have been explored really well.
HOWEVER, I think the reason people are still attracted to it are because the characters are very relatable.  That's why people are passionate.  Even as a teen reading them I recognized the ending would go and pull something that had never been explained before and would never happen again, but you were there for the journey.
I think the other thing is for people who read them as they were coming out there was a great community and tons of speculation and a lot of nostalgia attached to counting down the release dates for months and that draws people back.

A Mary sue is someone who basically bends the universe around themselves the moment they show up. People fawn over them, they're impossibly perfect, they flawlessly play matchmaker with all their friends, and so on.

Harry to me is very average. He escapes a horrible home and comes into magical wonderland where he can literally do magic... and he's kind of lazy at it. He certainly doesn't impress anybody with his magic prowess, other than being very good with a broom. He can be petty, arrogant and bad tempered, disobeys orders and nearly gets people killed.

A Mary Sue (or Gary Stu, whatever) version of Harry would be something like this: he'd have a traumatic childhood with the Dursleys, until his entrance into Hogwarts. There he'd instantly become the center of attention, grasp every subject, have a harem of his own, and shortly into his time there would humiliate Snape in front of the entire school. Hermione would become a background character mostly just in awe of his intellect, and so on, and so on.

t3_4g3nbn,d2f8c72,"The first books really work in that they follow really closely the ""hero's journey"" identified by Joseph Campbell.","The first books really work in that they follow really closely the ""hero's journey"" identified by Joseph Campbell. There is a common framework to HP that you also find in Star Wars :
&gt; Campbell defined the Hero Cycle, a course of events that occurs as a rite of initiation in every myth, pinpointing the need for mentors, villains, elixirs and jesters along the way. Each step can be traced in the adventures of Star Wars hero Luke Skywalker.

Also, the writing reminds me of Roal dahl (Charlie and the chocolate factory), and or Narnia. But not as good and the language used in HP is fare more difficult to read for children.

But eventually, it's more personal, and about the characters. When reading the book I need to identify with the characters. And I can't identify with Harry.

t3_4g3nbn,d2ec8tw,I've read the series in it's entirety.,"Harry Potter is perfectly accurately rated in as much as those who like the books like them, those who do not like them do not, and those that are indifferent remain indifferent.

I'm one of the third group. I've read the series in it's entirety. I wasn't particularly impressed, but was mildly entertained. More than anything I found the books were far better at triggering my memories of having read much better books when I was at that target age. If I was being uncharitable I'd say that I find the entire world that J.K created incredibly stupid and nonsensical. I don't say that much though, because there's no need to.

It is perfectly acceptable for something to not resonate with me, and there is no reason for me to denigrate that thing or anyone else's enjoyment of it. It doesn't hurt me at all for others to enjoy something I don't dig, and it doesn't serve anything positive for me to shit on others enjoyment. Sometimes something just isn't your cup of tea. In this case Harry Potter just ain't your thing.

Your criticisms are pretty basic ""I'm trying to find the reason I don't like this and am just listing off generic complaints"" fare. Everyone of them could be perfectly true, and people's enjoyment of them would be just as valid. I agree that no one should pretend like Harry Potter is on the literary level of The Brothers Karamozv, but I also believe that you shouldn't pretend that your ciritisisms are taking place in a 400 level literary crit dissertation.  You're just trying to find reasons to shit on someone else's enjoyment.

We already have disciplines, especially mathematics, that have been developing for thousands of years and we've never hit that limit.

I think you mostly touch on the ideas that have *already* prevented those limits from being reached in your post, but don't explain why the rules are changing. The reason I don't believe this will happen (at least not in the near future-- the introduction of advanced deep learning tech will almost certainly produce information that is beyond the grasp of human knowledge today.) is because once we discover something, teaching that thing is almost infinitely easier than the time it took to discover that thing. Computers are a great example-- they took almost a century from the prototypical idea of a computer to a computer that would be somewhat recognizable today, and have accelerated greatly over the past 3 decades.

I think the main reason I stopped thinking about it is the following: I think that we can postpone that moment for a very long time. Too long to make plans on how humans would even work at that moment.

&gt; spends a considerable time (years or decades depending on the domain) acquiring what others had built in that domain.

Let's say the limit would be reached if a field requiers like 60 years of study to be up to date. Nowadays, even when studying several connected subject (e.g : several Quantum physics subjects) , we barely spend 10 year studying it.

So i am pretty sure we still have a very long road to getting somewhat near to the limit!

If this limit is reached in a few hundred years, imagine how much would changed in the way we learn/think/research.  (Cf how much has changed in the last 50 years!)

Then what would happen would be more related to sience-fiction / imagination:

- Better teaching methods
- Biological enhancement to have memory work better (larger storage and better retrieving)
- Biological enhancement to have brain work faster (and we would improve the efficiency of the drug faster than we get to the limit in the domain of drug optimisation ...)
- Doubled life expectancy 
- Computers designed to inject knowledge into our brains ( ""I know kung fu"" matrix learning style)
- Having (quantum) computers smart enough to do the research themselves.

t3_4dat5a,d1pkkcg,Medicine is perhaps the most obvious example of information overload; it's impossible for a single physician to treat every possible disease state or even know how to go about proper diagnosis and initial management; rather they know when they don't know the answer and refer to colleagues with different specializations.,"This is a relatively simple point, but I think it is also worth noting that specialization has a role to play in combating the knowledge overload problem. 

Medicine is perhaps the most obvious example of information overload; it's impossible for a single physician to treat every possible disease state or even know how to go about proper diagnosis and initial management; rather they know when they don't know the answer and refer to colleagues with different specializations. We've gone from ""Doctors vs. Surgeons"" to separating out even individual fields into subspecialties (like interventional radiologist vs. diagnostic radiologist vs. interventional neuroradiologist).

I think medicine disciplines are somewhat unique because that knowledge needs to be active knowledge; you can't rely on the internet for near-instantaneous access, you need to know it, confidently, in the moment, so it's a better way of assessing whether individual humans are getting knowledge overload.

So the solution is not longer and longer training times (although we are seeing that to some degree), but rather more branch points within training, and becoming more specialized. This is obviously enhanced by the fact that the professors themselves are becoming more specialized.

&gt;When that individual reaches the edge of human knowledge [then  and only then] they can ... add a step forward through research and discovery.

I disagree.  I have several awarded patents, at least one of which really and truly is a cool innovation in a complex technical field.  But, I didn't have to fully understand that field to make progress.  I understood one little piece that was related to something I was working on, and then was able to see a better way of doing things in the thing I was working on, and to generalize that so other people working on other things could also do them better.

I would estimate I spent less than two years getting up to speed before I was in a position to make novel contributions to that field.

Yes, many people spend their entire careers in a single field, but they make multiple contributions during their careers.

As a cis woman, I have felt discomfort using unisex bathrooms. But when I think about it, the only basis for my discomfort was 'it's unusual'. The bathrooms are all stalls, so there's no risk of being exposed to unwanted genitalia. I am no more isolated or in danger than I would be passing through a corridor or in some barely-used stock cupboard, and we don't segregate those by gender.

Sometimes bathrooms are places where you go to sort out clothes or make up. I can go in a stall if I need to change and there's no reason to be uncomfortable with a guy seeing me touch up my foundation.

There is no real negative effect on me for being in the same bathroom as a guy, which means I need to get over my discomfort. So I try to do that, and it's gradually working.",3026,Verif,NonPers,Easy,1,3026,2022-05-01T14:45:14.551924Z,2022-05-01T14:45:14.551954Z,8.749

wait what? where did this come from? If sexual orientation is an issue then you're also going to have to restrict homosexual women.

If physical force is an issue then you're going to have to have a strength test that won't let anyone in to the bathroom if someone physically weaker than them is already in there. There are strong women and there are weak men.

If perceived threat is the issue then you're going to have to run background checks on every person that enters the bathroom, and not let anyone with a criminal history of violence
use a public bathroom.

This doesn't really make any sense and is pretty unnecessarily discriminatory.

t3_5w9qrn,de8rjka,Women use the men's restroom all the time.,"As a straight male I disagree with your quote in the title. Women use the men's restroom all the time. I've never seen nor heard of any women being harassed by men even though they are violating a male space. A man on the other hand entering the women's bathroom will ""make a ruckus"" to say the least. 

So besides then being rude this has nothing do to with the person going into the bathroom but more to do with the normal bathroom occupants. Women, in this case, are less mature than men.

t3_64kkxe,dg2uubt,Overbooking is in most cases a victimless crime.,"Is it fraud if there is no intention to defraud the alleged victim?  
Overbooking is in most cases a victimless crime. That is to say, in most cases, even though flights are overbooked, nobody has to leave the plane.  
The amount of overbooking is a carefully calculated number. Over the whole airlines know how many people are not going to show up to their flight.  
Have a flight of X passengers at date and time Y to destination Z an airline will know that (for example) 4 people on average aren't going to show up. Either being delayed, or cancelling or whatever reason.  
Now an airline has a choice, they can book to capacity, and wind up with 4 unsold tickets. This means that the airline eats the loss of those tickets, if they do this structurally, they'll have to find some way to recoup the losses. Perhaps by raising ticket prices in general.  
So if everything goes according to plan, everyone who arrives at the airport will be able to get on the plane, and everybody's happy, and they get to enjoy their cheap(er) tickets.

And this is of course the situations that the airline can control.

According to the US Department of Transport, there are two kinds of acceptable ""bumping"" from overbooked flights: voluntary and involuntary.  Voluntary bumping is the most frequent type, and this is what you normally see when the airline offers you incentives to voluntarily take a later flight.  Carriers are given a lot of freedom in how they negotiate with passengers in order to get volunteers, but it is frequently in the carrier's interest to get volunteers.  This is due to the regulations around involuntary bumping.  

Involuntary bumping requires the airline to arrange alternative travel arrangements that get the customer to their intended destination within 1 hour of their original scheduled arrival time.  If the customer arrives between 1 and 2 hours late, the carrier is forced to pay significant penalties to the customer for the inconvenience.  Any more than 2 hours incurs a 400% penalty that the carrier must pay to the customer.  This is all to protect the customer from overzealous overbooking.

t3_64kkxe,dg3cm1o,"If the customer arrives between 1 and 2 hours late, the carrier is forced to pay significant penalties to the customer for the inconvenience.","I see that your view has already been changed, but I thought I'd chime in with some additional info regarding flyer's rights in the US.  According to the US Department of Transport, there are two kinds of acceptable ""bumping"" from overbooked flights: voluntary and involuntary.  Voluntary bumping is the most frequent type, and this is what you normally see when the airline offers you incentives to voluntarily take a later flight.  Carriers are given a lot of freedom in how they negotiate with passengers in order to get volunteers, but it is frequently in the carrier's interest to get volunteers.  This is due to the regulations around involuntary bumping.  

Involuntary bumping requires the airline to arrange alternative travel arrangements that get the customer to their intended destination within 1 hour of their original scheduled arrival time.  If the customer arrives between 1 and 2 hours late, the carrier is forced to pay significant penalties to the customer for the inconvenience.  Any more than 2 hours incurs a 400% penalty that the carrier must pay to the customer.  This is all to protect the customer from overzealous overbooking.

Let's say the last two flights of the day to Alaska from LA leave at 8:00pm and 9:00pm.  Both of these flights have five available seats.  
  
There's passengers landing in LA that need to get on one of those two flights to Alaska, arriving on two different planes in LA at 7:00pm and 7:10pm, each with 5 passengers.  
  
So how should we schedule this?  Obviously put the people on the 7:00pm arrival onto the 8:00pm departure and the 7:10pm arrival on the 9:00pm departure.  That way there's no overbooking.  No problemo.  
  
But what if the 7:00pm arrival is late?  Now there's 10 people trying to get on the 9:00pm flight, so at least 5 people are going to have to wait until tomorrow.  And maybe tomorrow is fully booked so they're screwed.  
  
But is there a solution to this?  Yes!  Overbook EVERYONE on the 8:00pm flight so that flight is 5 seats overbooked and the 9:00pm flight is underbooked.  When the first flight is late, the 7:10pm arrivers get on the 8:00pm flight and the 7:00pm plane that actually arrived at 8:10pm gets its passengers on the later flight.  And EVERYONE gets to Alaska that day because overbooking saved the day.
  
Of course this usually means 5 people will get bumped from the 8:00pm flight to the 9:00pm flight.  Most likely they'll find volunteers to do it for $150.  But that's totally fine.

Let's say the last two flights of the day to Alaska from LA leave at 8:00pm and 9:00pm.  Both of these flights have five available seats.  
  
There's passengers landing in LA that need to get on one of those two flights to Alaska, arriving on two different planes in LA at 7:00pm and 7:10pm, each with 5 passengers.  
  
So how should we schedule this?  Obviously put the people on the 7:00pm arrival onto the 8:00pm departure and the 7:10pm arrival on the 9:00pm departure.  That way there's no overbooking.  No problemo.

t3_6vhdnm,dm0mt9z,They are very real and can kill you.,"Receiving alcoholic here. 

You’re drinking enough to build up a really really high tolerance. Eventually the alcohol will not work like it used to and your brain will physically start to produce less dopamine with that level of consumption. 

This means that the mental issues your trying to bandaid will get worse over time. That said, you’re not going to notice the slow gradual change because you’re too drunk to notice. You’ll notice when it’s too late. As hard as you think things used to be, recovery is 10x harder. 

Keep an eye out for withdrawal symptoms. These are going to be a sign that things have really gotten bad.  
- “Hangovers” that are cured by consuming more alcohol. 
- Shaking / sweating / nausea... feeling like you’re getting “food poisoning” more often. 
- Gastritis. Shitting more. Having frequent diarrhea.

I get where you're coming from. I do about the same thing, 8-10 light beers 3-4 times per week. And it is great! 

But as someone that used to drink 60+ per week and has spent the last year struggling to get down to a more reasonable amount I strongly recommend you do NOT get in the habit.

If you drink that much you will gain a ton of weight. You will feel like shit whenever you're not drinking. You'll be tired. Your stomach will hurt all the time. You'll have a lot of headaches. This constant hangover will effect your work and sober life negatively. You'll barely have enough energy to stay awake, let alone deal with people's bullshit.

I'm not going to tell you to stop drinking or cut back drastically. But if you drink more than you are now you will eventually regret it. And cutting back your drinking is a lot fucking harder than never drinking that heavily in the first place.

I dunno if you can get weed, but I find a little smoking and a 6 pack of regular beer or 8 light beers makes you feel great. 8-10 per night is still a little too high to maintain for years.

18 months ago she was diagnosed with stage 4 bilio-pancreatic cancer, which had already moved to her liver.  She started chemo, which basically made her unable to keep any food down.  Switching meds helped for a while, but then it'd happen again.  She dropped from just over 200 lbs, to around 85 lbs over that time.

She died last week, after suffering what we think was a stroke in the early morning. She lived for 2 days after that happened. Unable to speak, chew, swallow, or anything of that nature she passed away.

Drinking is awesome. There are great beers, wines, and liquors to try before your life is over. I would guess that booze now is the best it's ever been in the history of man, and it's only getting better. If handled right, it will be an amazing compliment to experiences for the rest of your life (a great red with a badass cut of meat, a glass of champagne to toast a special occasion (or to crank up and oj with brunch), a bourbon while sitting next to a fireplace on a cold night, a microbrew to drink while watching a movie or hanging out at a pub, a Pina colada to cool you down at the beach, etc.). You don't even need other people for those things if you don't want!

However, if you burn out on trash beer now (and likely progress to shitty cheap liquor), you'll never get to *enjoy* the better stuff. You'll end up drinking until you physically need it, you die, or you have to quit altogether. All of those are fucking terrible.

If you pace yourself, you'll be able to try it all and won't have to compromise future experiences to do it.

Do you have one and then continually crave until you get 2, and then 3, and then 4?

t3_6vhdnm,dm0jk8c,Once I failed out of school and was between jobs and I said to myself...Im going to take a month off from life and just drink as much beer as I want (12 pack a day or more) and watch baseball on TV and allow myself to use alcohol to temporarily feel better.,"I sort of get it.......with limits.  Once I failed out of school and was between jobs and I said to myself...Im going to take a month off from life and just drink as much beer as I want (12 pack a day or more) and watch baseball on TV and allow myself to use alcohol to temporarily feel better.

It worked.  After a month I started looking for work in earnest and decades later I kinda look fondly back on that time.  It was the right thing to do at that time....I was about 35

Here is the 'limit'.  I dont drink at all anymore because I dont like it anymore.  The hangovers become more destructive in your 40's.  Your liver cant take it.  You dont really notice it at the time but you are killing yourself quite quickly. Take a selfie and see how you're looking.  A bit beefy and pale?  bad skin?....imagine what your insides look like. 

I learned I dont even like the buzz of alcohol.  It is so predictable.  30 minutes of euphoria followed by a craving to drink more to maintain it or either clawing irritation or bad sleep.  It is good to mess with if you want to learn to release your inhibited character quickly and never have before, but if you are not careful you mistake the juice with your natural character and begin to build an unhealthy association quickly.

Just give it a rest after a few months.  If you see you can't you know you have a problem.   Get another job or change your life in some other meaningful way soon.

Is it perfect? Not really. But many countries you listed dont have a system in place to protect the freedom of its citizens. And while they enjoy many freedoms now they can disappear when some authority decides to strip them away.


The reason thats so is because the US government cannot provide freedom. **The Constitution was written specifically so that the government couldnt *infringe* on the peoples freedom.**

We also have very real diversity, which is something not found in the countries you listed.   

But I would argue you don't have real freedom anyway.  What you mean by ""freedom"" is agreement with what the government allows you to do.  The United States has as close to absolute freedom as you can really get.  There is very little we have to actually do because the federal government tells us we have to whereas the government plays a huge roll in the countries you listed.

I've been to Denmark and liked it very much but it's a country of about 5M people.  I live in a city that has almost double the population.  You can't really compare a country with the United State's population with countries so much smaller than it.

We also have very real diversity, which is something not found in the countries you listed.   

But I would argue you don't have real freedom anyway.  What you mean by ""freedom"" is agreement with what the government allows you to do.  The United States has as close to absolute freedom as you can really get.  There is very little we have to actually do because the federal government tells us we have to whereas the government plays a huge roll in the countries you listed.  This is also probably the reason why 20th century Europe spent so much time under the thumb of strongmen like Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, Franco, etc.  When the government basically controls everything, it's easy for these strongmen to take over.

t3_6ihcuk,dj68xot,To a person who feels that life begins at conception a pro-choicer is a endorsing murder.,"
&gt;The simple fact is that trying to define the point at which a zygote or a fetus becomes ""a person"" is pointless.

It's not at all pointless.

There's more to this issue than human life-if it's not a human life than it's part of a woman's body.

So if it's a life it's a murder issue, if it's not then it's a women's rights issue.

I think that this is why abortion is one of if not the most difficult political issues. To a person who feels that life begins at conception a pro-choicer is a endorsing murder. To a person who disagrees the pro-lifer is violating a woman's right to her own body.


&gt;That being said, we as a society don't care about human life above all else, nor should we. Life has a variable value depending on the factors weighed against it.

We weigh risk versus reward.

So let's throw out speed limits and abortion and look at the concept of fighting.

We allow sports like MMA and boxing because the risk of injury, while high, can be offset by regulations and standards.

We don't allow pistol duels, however, because the risk shoots up beyond a point where regulations can properly control.

So higher speed limits assume risk but we offset that with safety technology, vehicle inspection, DWI laws and police presence.

We can't control for risk in an abortion. The risk is very nearly 100%-the goal is to end the pregnancy.

Now I'm pro choice so obviously I don't take the pro life view. But I don't believe that the comparison you're making really helps the debate-very few people would endorse activity that guarantees the death of a child.

&gt;The simple fact is that trying to define the point at which a zygote or a fetus becomes ""a person"" is pointless.

It's not at all pointless.

There's more to this issue than human life-if it's not a human life than it's part of a woman's body.

So if it's a life it's a murder issue, if it's not then it's a women's rights issue.

I think that this is why abortion is one of if not the most difficult political issues. To a person who feels that life begins at conception a pro-choicer is a endorsing murder. To a person who disagrees the pro-lifer is violating a woman's right to her own body.


&gt;That being said, we as a society don't care about human life above all else, nor should we. Life has a variable value depending on the factors weighed against it.

We weigh risk versus reward.

So let's throw out speed limits and abortion and look at the concept of fighting.

We allow sports like MMA and boxing because the risk of injury, while high, can be offset by regulations and standards.

We don't allow pistol duels, however, because the risk shoots up beyond a point where regulations can properly control.

So higher speed limits assume risk but we offset that with safety technology, vehicle inspection, DWI laws and police presence.

We can't control for risk in an abortion. The risk is very nearly 100%-the goal is to end the pregnancy.

Whether the fetus survives out of the womb is a separate question, and should not interfere with a person's rights over her own body. If the fetus is aborted after 8 months, chances are the baby will survive with medical support.

Of course, this makes for a more diffucult but also more interesting debate: How far do we go to keep aborted fetuses alive? (Or babies I suppose, once they're out of the womb.) To me, this is hard to answer before we can put a value on human life. For those who don't understand why that is hard: Imagine creating an AI that will work to make life on earth optimal.

Christianity Today, the flagship magazine of the Evangelical Right, was publishing articles immediately after Roe praising the decision as morally and religiously correct.

It wasn't until the late 1970's that the religious right suddenly switched to believing that abortion was the ultimate evil, and that switch didn't fully complete until the early 1980's.

&gt; apart from very specific circumstances, attractive people have a huge advantage over unattractive people in every way of life, 

This is one argument and I disagree, ""every way of life"" is relative. There are downsides to being very attractive, you focus on romance all the time and never have alone time. Ever realize how some very attractive people seem to be less intellectual, at least in terms of their character? That is at least a stereotype that is out there that could have an ounce of truth to it.

I agree that being attractive comes with social advantages, most of them very small and/or short term advantages. 

But it doesn't mean people who are less relatively ""attractive"" (how do you define that btw?) live a horrible existence, nor does it mean they don't have their own unique advantages.






&gt; therefore I see nothing wrong with getting cosmetic surgery to make myself look better

This is a separate thought. There is nothing inherently ""wrong"" about it, regardless of your previous thought. 

There are advantages (possible help in social sphere of life, finding a partner, etc), and disadvantages (possible long term effects, can negatively change perception of appearance depending  on who's looking).

t3_6h7a4i,diw8bah,Plastic surgery cashes in on people's insecurities that have been created by the media and promises them the holy land of beauty.,"I'd suggest that many people oftentimes perceive themselves to look ugly because we are continually being blasted by the media with the ""ideal"" bodies, faces, styles, hair etc, so that you are comparing yourself with fantasy images doctored by all kinds of photoshopping and editing. Plastic surgery cashes in on people's insecurities that have been created by the media and promises them the holy land of beauty. Changing your perspective and rethinking how you look at yourself can feel like the most impossible thing in the world, but from my experience (someone who used dream about getting something done to fix my somewhat uneven nose) it's been the key step in getting over how I think people might be perceiving me and to just live my life. I've managed to enjoy relationships with people that presumably considered me attractive enough to date, whereas years ago I felt horrible and unattractive. 

On a more social level, I would never judge anyone for getting plastic surgery, but I don't believe that the insecurities and impossible standards it fosters and idealises is healthy for a community and for young people going forward.

There's also the fact that plastic surgery can often become an (extremely expensive) addiction, and that once you ""fix"" one thing, you begin to notice another ""imperfection"" and on and on. ",8693,Verif,NonPers,Easy,2,8693,2022-05-12T11:31:54.176708Z,2022-05-12T11:31:54.176752Z,2.102

I can without a doubt say that it has given me advantages in certain situations.  However, I am also a fairly introverted person which means I'm not super confident in situations where I have to put my self out there, make small talk, network, etc. I find that (1) more extroverted (and seemingly confident) people have the more significant advantage than just conventionally good looking people, and (2) I often feel more uncomfortable because people assume that because of my stature and looks that I should be this super confident, smooth-talking individual. I often feel like people are let down or act weird around me when they realize my personality doesn't match what they anticipated based on my looks.  Of course, there is a lot of personal bias here, just one guy's opinion.  

On another note, being good looking has made me more superficial.  I've gotten way better looking as I got older and I noticed that it made people feel like it was okay to criticize the looks of the girls I dated because ""dude, you're a stud, you can get a way better looking girl."" It shouldn't bother me or affect how I see people but it has.

t3_6h7a4i,diwmr69,"Plastic surgery is expensive, thus the only people who can get it are those with the means to do so.","I guess this depends on what you consider moral? I think it's *understandable* that someone would get plastic surgery and I don't judge anyone for it because I think you're right, most of the time attractiveness grants you positive privileges. But I would argue that it's possibly immoral and here's why, gonna try to keep this concise 

I think you're right that attractive people generally have easier lives than unattractive people. I think it's also (indisputably) true that people with more money also have easier lives. Plastic surgery is expensive, thus the only people who can get it are those with the means to do so. Meaning that plastic surgery will only enhance the lives of those who already have a better life than those who can't afford it. Therefore, normalizing plastic surgery creates a further divide in the quality of life between the (for lack of a better term) poor and ugly and the more affluent and beautiful (whether natural or not).

So in conclusion, I definitely think plastic surgery is beneficial for your own self interest. However for society as a whole, it seems at best neutral (CMV?) and at worst detrimental by widening the ""quality of life"" gap between the poor and the (relatively) affluent, and therefore isn't moral

TL;DR people who can afford plastic surgery already have a better quality of life than those who can't --&gt; normalizing plastic surgery could result in more inequality --&gt; plastic surgery is amoral at best but arguably immoral   ",8728,Verif,NonPers,Easy,2,8728,2022-05-12T11:31:54.176708Z,2022-05-12T11:31:54.176752Z,2.102

As an aging male, I can talk in detail about hair transplant surgery.  It is definitely cosmetic surgery, but society doesn't treat it the same way as something like a boob job.

As I got older and my hair started receding, I am completely happy buying some clippers and shaving it down to 1/16th of an inch once a week.  I have a nice, round head, and I think I look good compared to other people my age.

My coworker got transplant surgery, sports a full head of hair, and has to take a couple of pills every morning to keep things working.

This comes down to a personal choice for both of us.  To him, losing his hair was a big deal, to me, I'd rather not have to take pills if I don't have to, so it wasn't even a consideration.

We both have our ways of dealing with our flaws, and we both feel good about our choices.  If you want cosmetic surgery to make YOURSELF feel better about YOURSELF, it can be a big ego boost and help you in general, I've seen it change people for the better and can definitely be worth the investment.

If there is something else you can do to make yourself feel better and you think the surgery might be overkill, then by all means try that first.  It's probably cheaper, safer, and easier.

t3_6h7a4i,diwtyzp,"Cosmetic surgery is meant to make you and you alone happy, and feel more comfortable in your own skin, not to please others senses.","The only problem I have with cosmetic surgery (I'm getting work done myself) is that you are not being genetically honest to your prospective partners. Say you have a cleft chin, some women hate it, others love it. You choose to get a chin implant/filler and the women who would normally disregard you for this feature would now suddenly go for you. Then, the woman has a child with you and the kid has a cleft chin, where did that come from? 

Of course, this is an extremely obscure example but it is used just for effect. Same with hair transplants, balding early may be a bad genetic sign to some women, as is a hooked nose, a double chin, dark under eyes, etc. 

I believe the best time to get cosmetic surgery is once you are in a committed relationship, so that you are changing you for you, and not to get a partner or to benefit others. The partner would be on board ideally, and already know how your genes looked originally.

As soon as they have their better trade agreements there will be no one left to trade in the UK because the investors all go to safer countries, especially since Germany is still price-dumping all other countries with their low inflation rate and unit labor cost (which is actually the main reason for the euro crisis and not Greece).

In this referendum, these forgotten people *actually* had an chance to change the political establishment, and they did!

This was probably the last chance to end a sleepwalking political system that has neglected an entire class of our society. I had feared what would become if this situation had we remained unchanged, had our government and the EU not listened to these people.

From the article:

&gt;Green says that no legal provision was included in the EU referendum legislation that requires UK Parliament to act in accordance with the outcome of the referendum. 

So your view that Britain is screwed is probably wrong just based on that, I would wager. I sincerely doubt that this referendum will become law. I think that this situaion will turn out to be similar to the one wherein Greeks *overwhelmingly* voted ""OXI"" and then their PM Tsiprias, who was in favor of ""OXI"" mind you, turned around and caved into the EU the very next day. Yesyes, the situations *are* different, of course, but considering the absolute lashing the pound is getting and the instability created in local and world markets over this, I do sincerely doubt that it will be enacted into law.

t3_61zvnh,dfk5wcg,The problem here is you're using a word that is loaded with negative connotations.,"The problem here is you're using a word that is loaded with negative connotations.

""Black"", ""brown"", ""red"", ""yellow"", ""white""--these words are not necessarily meant to hurt anyone but emphasizes the abstract division between **races** that oversimplifies the purpose of making such divisions. Worse, these divisions encourage a competition between the **races** where the ""whites"" are apparently winning for so long now. Saying ""black"" as is could be seen as something okay to do, but calling someone ""black"" to remind them of their inferiority is so common that every instance of the word black already sounds offensive regardless of meaning, and unless the competition, the discrimination is ended, the negative connotations would remain.

True, saying someone is African-American might not seem a bit accurate in terms of describing a person's **nationality** or **ethnicity** of which saying he's Jamaican or Latino would be more okay maybe, but African-American is a much better word than black, and gives a better view of what **race** your physical attributes suggest, not just your skin color, if you're describing someone's physical features.

But if your point is just to not offend people, that's subjective so ask the people you're describing if they're offended that you call them names.

Note: Caucasians not being offended by being called white does not in any way mean that african-americans should also not be offended. It is not double-standard. It's called perspective. It would even suggest that the caucasians indeed have a superiority on everyone else, such that ""black"" has become so offensive and ""white"" not.

t3_42efvs,cz9sw0g,&gt; the vast bulk of these people are not refugees.,"&gt; the vast bulk of these people are not refugees. They're economic migrants

I realise this is a side issue to your main question, but you're suggesting that refugees are OK but economic migrants aren't, which is at best simplistic. A refugee is just someone who's been granted asylum whereas 'economic migrants' is just a blanket term for anyone who's migrated anywhere hoping for a better standard of living. That doesn't make them some kind of grasping plague of locusts, it just means that they haven't officially applied for asylum. 

If civil war has reduced you to begging for food out of the rubble of your former home to feed your children, with no heating and temperatures dropping below freezing at night, then I think any sane person would try to find a better life for themselves. You wouldn't use the people traffickers crossing the Mediterranean in suicidal conditions unless you were truly desperate.

I don't know where you're from OP, but here in the UK there is often a kind of sneer that goes alongside 'economic migrant' as if to suggest they're just greedy for some kind of charmed life living off government handouts, whereas actually these are usually desperate people whose lives have been completely destroyed through no fault of their own.

I realise this is a side issue to your main question, but you're suggesting that refugees are OK but economic migrants aren't, which is at best simplistic. A refugee is just someone who's been granted asylum whereas 'economic migrants' is just a blanket term for anyone who's migrated anywhere hoping for a better standard of living. That doesn't make them some kind of grasping plague of locusts, it just means that they haven't officially applied for asylum. 

If civil war has reduced you to begging for food out of the rubble of your former home to feed your children, with no heating and temperatures dropping below freezing at night, then I think any sane person would try to find a better life for themselves. You wouldn't use the people traffickers crossing the Mediterranean in suicidal conditions unless you were truly desperate.

Had you used more accurate language in your statement, e.g. ""eroding cultures"", then your argument might've survived a few more sentences.

I also take issue with your conflation of two terms: immigrants and refugees. Whilst a refugee is technically an immigrant, I feel that your argument of ""Europe is currently taking on hundreds of thousands of immigrants almost instantaneously"" is ignoring the reasoning behind the migration, which underpins the difficulties these people are experiencing adjusting to their new homes. Anyone migrating through Europe escaping ISIS or other regimes from the Middle East are likely doing so as refugees, seeking solitude in a safer country. That will naturally take some adjusting. Whereas the ""sizeable Muslim population"" you refer to that currently lives in Australia that has ""For the most parts, [...] integrate enough to function as part of Australian society"" have in the most part probably not migrated as refugees and certainly not under the circumstances as those currently.

It really boils down to a bigger question: Is consent independent on your ability to make decisions?

The situation should be seen equivalent to a scenario, where you are pointed a gun against your head, and told to give the attacker all you got. Clearly, by your logic, this was all under consent and purely a valid transaction.

The fact that the violater actually pointed a gun towards your head, therefore making a threat, is clearly immoral, but your action was consensual.

Would you call this scenario fair?

Despite there not being a threat in the scenario you mentioned, the essence is the same: One part is giving (invalid) consent, another part is violating.

It follows from your conclusion that children are able to give consent to sexual activity. Children are clearly incapable of making deliberate decisions, but since, by your conclusion, that won't affect your ability to give consent, they would clearly be able to do so, right?

Let me propose a similar situation to that of a highly intoxicated person consenting:
A 13-14 year old girl willingly has sex with a 30 year old man. Did she give consent? I suppose, but was she raped? absolutely! That is textbook statutory rape. Why though? 
It's because society as deemed the decisions of minors to engage in sexual acts as not legally binding. We do not consider the brains of minors to be capable of making a fully informed rational decision and therefore the decision to engage in intercourse is judged to be entirely that of the 30 year old man, in the eyes of the law the man agreed to sex, the girl couldn't, hence the man is considered to have raped her. 

Now let me draw comparisons between this case and that of an intoxicated woman who is of age. 
While intoxicated you are incapable of making fully informed, educated, rational decisions. Therefore by the same logic that makes statutory rape illegal we must also draw the conclusion that anyone who is mentally impaired cannot consent to sex with another person and that only the man in our scenario consented to sex, ergo: rape.

You've described two scenarios that both make sense on the face of it - but it seems pretty clear to me that there are other important scenarios to consider.

In particular, there's the case of a person who is so drunk that no reasonable person would consider them capable of understanding what they were consenting to.  So while they might say ""yes"" when propositioned for sex, they might also say ""yes"" when propositioned for a long jump off the edge of a cliff, and they clearly don't understand what they're saying yes to.  

I would consider sex between such a person and a reasonably sober person rape, and I think you would too at some level of intoxication somewhere between ""super drunk"" and ""incapacitated"".

I dont think consent can be given legally if one party is under the influence of alcohol, however if both are similarly drunk then neither can legally consent and any sort of legal action against either one would cancel the other out.
