As a consequence, it was more likely that those with a university education in that part of the country would be wearing red trousers. It does not, however, follow that red trousers are a more intelligent choice of clothing. It is simply the case that the demographic in which red trousers became popular was coincidentally a demographic of university-educated people. Moreover, wearing red trousers became a way of *signalling* your membership in that demographic.  

This example is obviously not directly comparable to your point of view, but I think it serves to illustrate a point. The demographic of college-educated people may hold certain views or find certain things fashionable even though these views are not directly caused by their being college educated. 

More generally your argument suffers from some correlation to causation inferences. That just because having a degree is correlated to holding certain view-points, it follows that those view-points are caused by having a degree. The full picture is usually vastly more complicated than that.

There are also reasons one might want to lower taxes other than the ones you state. Lowering the right corporate tax rates might encourage entrepreneurship, and lowering tax rates generally might cause an increase in spending which may lead to increased total tax revenue.

t3_62igvv,dfnxe4l,It can be very much the opposite.,"It can be very much the opposite. 

Education can indeed be a process of indoctrination. The sort of education that is useful to a person depends very much on their individual talents and intelligence.

Also, if being liberal is correlated to higher education, then higher education is correlated to being an anti-vacciner and consuming homeopathic medication, as that is correlated more with liberals. That's a sign college isn't teaching them to think critically.

Higher education is correlated with higher income. Within a given state, a higher income is correlated with conservatism (the richer you get within your city/state, the more likely you are to be a conservative). That automatically contradicts your statement.

A better way to describe the people pick sides is a reflection of psychological tendencies and the tribalistic nature of humanbeings. There are many books written on this. In reality those who know the most about politics/economics recognize validities in both sides and are actually moderate. People are not vulcans (startrek). They rarely change their view simply because they have been presented with new information, especially because political leanings tend to be important for how we view ourselves. Cognitive dissonance is a powerful thing. How often have you seen someone be presented with new information then all of a sudden admit ignorance and switch sides? No one likes to admit that they are wrong. 

This is key fault in a democracy where everyone votes. It is relatively easy to manipulate the population. What is ironic is that those who understand everything the best often do not vote since they understand that their vote is meaningless. There are stats which show that the voting population is actually far less knowledgeable on policies and their effects than the general population.

t3_62igvv,dfnex3f,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/07/the-case-against-democracy/amp,"This is an innacurrate simplification of voter behavior. A better way to describe the people pick sides is a reflection of psychological tendencies and the tribalistic nature of humanbeings. There are many books written on this. In reality those who know the most about politics/economics recognize validities in both sides and are actually moderate. People are not vulcans (startrek). They rarely change their view simply because they have been presented with new information, especially because political leanings tend to be important for how we view ourselves. Cognitive dissonance is a powerful thing. How often have you seen someone be presented with new information then all of a sudden admit ignorance and switch sides? No one likes to admit that they are wrong. 

This is key fault in a democracy where everyone votes. It is relatively easy to manipulate the population. What is ironic is that those who understand everything the best often do not vote since they understand that their vote is meaningless. There are stats which show that the voting population is actually far less knowledgeable on policies and their effects than the general population.

The divide between conservative and liberal views is probably more based on self interest than one side being dumb and the other ""educated"". Rural voters tend to be conservative and they are affected more by immigrants competing for jobs, have less diversity(therefore tend to have less interest in civil rights, social justice issues} and tend to benefit less from taxes, as public works and services are more concentrated in cities.

The best example of both sides critically thinking yet voting differently due to environment is gun control. Areas(large cities) with high concentrations of liberal voters tend to live in more populated areas and tend to typically have the benefit of police showing up quickly in response to crimes and also are more likely to notice irresponsible gun use(gang violence etc.) On the flip side a conservative voter in a rural area might see more value in keeping guns around because police wouldn't be able to respond fast enough if their house was broken into, and due to being in a rural area they see more utility to the use of guns for hunting.

So really voting is more a matter of issues affecting people differently and therefore coming to different conclusions on what policy should be.

t3_6694ui,dggz172,Freedom comes with a price.,"Maybe I can appeal to your Libertarian side.  Think about all the other rights people have.  In America, we also have 4th Amendment rights against search and seizure.  If we got rid of this right, the police could search any private residence they wish, at any time.  If they did this in high crime neighborhoods, the crime rate, particularly the violent crime rate, would plummet.  And if you haven't done anything wrong, you have nothing to hide, right?

My point above is, just because there are less murders and crimes when you take away peoples freedoms, it doesn't necessarily make it a good thing. I'm sure there are very few violent crimes in North Korea, because they have no rights.  Freedom comes with a price.  Criminals of course can exploit these freedoms, but that's the price we pay to live in a free society.

That's not the numbers talking, it's the BBC (i.e. fake news) talking. Just look at their sources - pure bias.

The number of people murdered with guns, for example, is irrelevant.

&gt;Yes, cars also kill people, but I don't need a gun to get to work.

Special pleading. More people are killed by cars than guns but that's okay because walking is inconvenient?

""More than 30,000 people on average are killed by gun violence across the country each year, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.""

Which of course is a lie. That's the *total* number of deaths, including accident and suicide, murder, justifiable homicide and cops shooting criminals. People who lie to you are not your friends.

The number of people murdered with guns, for example, is irrelevant. The number would be pretty much the same even if there weren't any guns available (the availability of guns make no difference to the homicide rate), but the article is trying to insinuate that the US homicide rate would be 60% lower if it wasn't for guns, which it wouldn't (note the lack of details over whether the homicide was justifiable or not - they don't seem to think it matters).

&gt;Yes, cars also kill people, but I don't need a gun to get to work.

Special pleading. More people are killed by cars than guns but that's okay because walking is inconvenient?

&gt;With guns, the only benefits arise when a really tough intruder is in my house or when the government is trying to oppress me.

That sounds like a trump card to me. And your description of home defence (""shooting everything in sight"") is very childish.",4352,UnVerif,,,1,4352,2022-05-02T09:27:41.607725Z,2022-05-02T09:27:41.607756Z,5.251

They also happen to be the largest percent of gun owners, while also having the lowest amount of gun murders. In fact, almost non-existent.

You don't understand why Americans need guns. If any other country has a government takeover/dictator they have the United States to keep them in check. We see this with Russia and Putin now. He can't do anything because at some point the United States can stop him. The citizens there would benefit from guns but they don't need them since America keeps their dictator in check.

If there is a government takeover/dictator in America no one can keep them in check. Germany isn't going to do shit. Russia won't do shit. China won't do shit. They would all get rolled over by our military. This dictator would have the power to take over the world and enslave/genocide anyone they want.

Your best bet is a technological development that is superior to guns (same stopping capacity, but not fatal) such as an [Electrolaser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolaser). Then, you could make that available for home or personal defense and further restrict conventional gunpowder-driven weaponry and *far* fewer people would go apeshit about it.",4530,UnVerif,,,1,4530,2022-05-02T14:52:58.091155Z,2022-05-02T14:52:58.091190Z,6.353

t3_6694ui,dggp91o,The statistics you posted specifically focus on gun related violence.,"The statistics you posted specifically focus on gun related violence. If someone was murdered, I don't care whether they were shot, stabbed, poisoned, bludgeoned, etc. When guns are banned or tightly controlled, gun violence goes down, but that says nothing of violence in general. 

Guns are an equalizer. There are some elderly members of my family who carry guns (fully compliant with the law of our state). If someone tried to mug them, either with bare handed or with a knife, they wouldn't stand a chance on their own. With a gun, my 74 year old grandmother stands a chance against an 18 year old guy who decides she looks weak. 

If you ban guns, that 18 year old guy is going to be pretty damn sure my 74 year old grandma isn't packing, which means there is very little physical risk to him mugging her. If it's legal to carry guns, he's going to think twice about whether that 74 year old lady is really worth it, and she doesn't even have to be carrying for the law to create those second thoughts.

Best wishes!","Congratulations, you've pre-judged yourself on the basis of your nationality.

I was born and raised (until 10) in Russia.  I don't consider myself Russian-American, and if pressed, I don't really consider myself Russian.  Here's the kicker: while I'm a naturalized citizen of the United States, *I don't really consider myself American either*.  (edit: I consider myself a Human Being first and foremost, a citizen of Earth as corny as that sounds, because as soon as you become part of a team, left/right, american/notamerican, theist/atheist, lol/dota, you have taken something personal away from yourself and instead let yourself be described by a vague label, something I'm not at all keen on.)

If you want to be a nationalist, that has to be earned, either through stupidity or military indoctrination or something.

Is there a prototypical ""American"" identity that celebrates Thanksgiving, Easter, Christmas, and their kids eat PB&amp;J sandwiches for lunch? Yes.

You will never have the same experience as the other people who are multiple generations deep into this country, but that doesn't make you less American than they are. You grew up here just like them, and that's what makes you American. You're a different kind of American than they are, but that's not intrinsically good or bad.
