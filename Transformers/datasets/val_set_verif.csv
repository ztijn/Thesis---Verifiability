A better way to describe the people pick sides is a reflection of psychological tendencies and the tribalistic nature of humanbeings. There are many books written on this. In reality those who know the most about politics/economics recognize validities in both sides and are actually moderate. People are not vulcans (startrek). They rarely change their view simply because they have been presented with new information, especially because political leanings tend to be important for how we view ourselves. Cognitive dissonance is a powerful thing. How often have you seen someone be presented with new information then all of a sudden admit ignorance and switch sides? No one likes to admit that they are wrong. 

This is key fault in a democracy where everyone votes. It is relatively easy to manipulate the population. What is ironic is that those who understand everything the best often do not vote since they understand that their vote is meaningless. There are stats which show that the voting population is actually far less knowledgeable on policies and their effects than the general population.

Only one of those statistics has any meaning in the argument to restrict gun ownership, the overall homicide rate. The rest improperly separate shootings from other means of violence, while it is the total rate of that general form of violence that is important. Mass shootings are only a meaningful statistic as a portion of all mass murders.

Given that the non-gun homicide rate of the US is not comparable to the non-gun homicide rate of the other countries, the presence of a large contingent of gun-related homicides cannot be said to be extra. We could easily see the method change without a meaningful alteration in total homicide rate.

For the one honest statistic presented in your link to be convincing, it would need to demonstrate a relatively consistent non-gun homicide rate across many countries with and without gun restrictions, alongside a high gun homicide rate solely in countries with those restrictions.

That's not the numbers talking, it's the BBC (i.e. fake news) talking. Just look at their sources - pure bias.

Take a look at [this recent article for example](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-39636104).

The number of people murdered with guns, for example, is irrelevant.

If someone was murdered, I don't care whether they were shot, stabbed, poisoned, bludgeoned, etc. When guns are banned or tightly controlled, gun violence goes down, but that says nothing of violence in general. 

Guns are an equalizer. There are some elderly members of my family who carry guns (fully compliant with the law of our state). If someone tried to mug them, either with bare handed or with a knife, they wouldn't stand a chance on their own. With a gun, my 74 year old grandmother stands a chance against an 18 year old guy who decides she looks weak. 

If you ban guns, that 18 year old guy is going to be pretty damn sure my 74 year old grandma isn't packing, which means there is very little physical risk to him mugging her. If it's legal to carry guns, he's going to think twice about whether that 74 year old lady is really worth it, and she doesn't even have to be carrying for the law to create those second thoughts. 

So back to the statistics you cited: sure gun violence goes down in places where guns are banned, but go look up statistics for other violent crimes correlating to gun control measures and you'll see that gun control doesn't make much difference for violence as a whole, and can even make certain populations easier targets.

If someone tried to mug them, either with bare handed or with a knife, they wouldn't stand a chance on their own. With a gun, my 74 year old grandmother stands a chance against an 18 year old guy who decides she looks weak. 

If you ban guns, that 18 year old guy is going to be pretty damn sure my 74 year old grandma isn't packing, which means there is very little physical risk to him mugging her. If it's legal to carry guns, he's going to think twice about whether that 74 year old lady is really worth it, and she doesn't even have to be carrying for the law to create those second thoughts. 

So back to the statistics you cited: sure gun violence goes down in places where guns are banned, but go look up statistics for other violent crimes correlating to gun control measures and you'll see that gun control doesn't make much difference for violence as a whole, and can even make certain populations easier targets.

Here's the kicker: while I'm a naturalized citizen of the United States, *I don't really consider myself American either*.  (edit: I consider myself a Human Being first and foremost, a citizen of Earth as corny as that sounds, because as soon as you become part of a team, left/right, american/notamerican, theist/atheist, lol/dota, you have taken something personal away from yourself and instead let yourself be described by a vague label, something I'm not at all keen on.)

If you want to be a nationalist, that has to be earned, either through stupidity or military indoctrination or something.  I have not become a nationalist, while I agree that U.S. is an amazing and incredible place to live, affording opportunities to the people like few modern countries do.  Its not perfect, it is corrupt to the core, but its the best we got.

The point I'm trying to make is that its up to you what you consider yourself.  And if others are racist/nationalist against you, you can't fix that.  Take 100 people in a room, and at least 1 will be inclined to hate you for no reason.  Scale that to 300 million...

In fact, due to my joking nature, I've called white people crackers and my black friends niggas in friendly manners (probably not that sensitive, but I was young and they were good friends.)

Something that differentiates my experience from yours, from what I've read, is that you tried hard to assimilate and abandon your Korean identity, while I embraced it and used it as part of my character. Surrounded by white kids in a suburban environment, I found being Korean was something that made me unique and gave me a sense of identity, and I often incorporated my nationality into conversations (perhaps a little too much, which I still cringe at to this day.)

This excludes people who already spoke English, as dialectal accents don't go away as easily, so I don't assume anything with them. My friend's dad still has a 100% London accent despite living here I think most of his adult life. The people who make you feel not American might be ones who didn't get to experience more diversity as they grew up. I don't look twice when I see a woman in a burqa pushing a stroller past African American Vernacular English speaking black kids playing basketball at the park while an Indian kid, a white kid, and a Filipino kid all play tag around the playground.

I would expand the way you look at statuses of foreigner and natives. For example, a white Caucasian male born and raised in NYC will be a foreigner in rural Alabama. A black woman born and raised in Chicago will be a foreigner in the whitest parts of Connecticut. A rich person will always be a foreigner amongst his peers that grew up poor, even if they grew up in the same time and place.

t3_6r0yd5,dl1wfjs,A black woman born and raised in Chicago will be a foreigner in the whitest parts of Connecticut.,"Culture is far more important than the melanin in your skin or the shape of your eyes. It's the shared experiences, the language, the part of lives that allow us to relate to one another that differentiates us. People will always be a foreigner to those that they did not grow up in the same conditions and environment as them.  

I would expand the way you look at statuses of foreigner and natives. For example, a white Caucasian male born and raised in NYC will be a foreigner in rural Alabama. A black woman born and raised in Chicago will be a foreigner in the whitest parts of Connecticut. A rich person will always be a foreigner amongst his peers that grew up poor, even if they grew up in the same time and place. 

Is there a prototypical ""American"" identity that celebrates Thanksgiving, Easter, Christmas, and their kids eat PB&amp;J sandwiches for lunch? Yes. But that doesn't make them *the* standard for being American. You will never have the same experience as the other people who are multiple generations deep into this country, but that doesn't make you less American than they are. You grew up here just like them, and that's what makes you American. You're a different kind of American than they are, but that's not intrinsically good or bad.
